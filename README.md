# an (incomplete) ICM42688 driver based on `esp_hal`
half of this is not done because i didnt need it for my application and i wasnt bothered
no documentation because im not bothered
if you use this maybe contribute please
essentially a port of (this library)[https://github.com/finani/ICM42688]

made for esp32c3, not sure if it works on others or how to make it work
